# Notes
The source code that is inside of the folders does not have the `node_modules` folder, to add this in, simply go into your terminal and type in `npm i`. This will read the `package.json` file and download all of the modules. Also, in the token part, it says something like `your-token-here`. Replace that text with your bot token which you can find in the [**Discord Developer Portal**](http://discord.com/developers/).
